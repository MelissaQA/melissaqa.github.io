Web site for the "Become in a GIT expert" class

On this repo you will find a website based on the template "resume" from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CTv7f8jR3N9s7nOZvZYDG2X8vcyyFomN (Thanks to the creator! :)

The project has an only web page that uses HTML and CSS with bootstrap. I've used some sections alredy existed, but I've added two sections in the main page: Speaker and Contact.

It's my first website using bootstrap, so, it needs to be improved. You can visit it on: https://melissaqa.github.io/
